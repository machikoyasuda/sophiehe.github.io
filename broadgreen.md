<i>99 Homes</i> is an acclaimed indie thriller set in Florida during the 2008 housing crisis. For Broad Green Pictures, we launched a digital campaign that explored the tension between the film's pervasive themes of power vs. morality. I helped craft the copy.

What is power? How does it look and feel? In honor of the film's Gordon Gekko-esque villain, we showcased all 99 elements of power in this shareable digital experience.
